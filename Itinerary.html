            <section id="Rotorua">
                <h2>Rotorua</h2>
                <p>The first stop where we will be spending some time, we will be driving to Rotorua once we land in Auckland. Upon arriving and checking in to our hotel, this will be the main place where we will experience a number of Lord of the Rings activities.</p>

                <p>With tours going around locations that were filmed for the movies, we will have a decent amount to do here. Along with this, we will also be making the most of the hot springs to recover from all the walking on the tours. To finish off, the Waititi Caves that the glow worms have called their homes we feel is a must.</p>

            <section id="Wellington">
                <h2>Wellington</h2>
                <p>Wellington is a stop off that we need to do so we can get to the south island with the hire cars. Looking around, there are some interesting things that we can do here that have led to us committing to a few days in this location. We have arranged a brewery tour and are looking to book a round of Golf at the local Wellington Golf Course.</p>

            <section id="Queenstown">
                <h2>Queenstown</h2>
                <p>Queenstown is the last place that we will be staying and where we will be doing most of the adrenaline sports. With nice Ski Lodges and several different activities to do around, we will be dividing and concurring. While skiing is going to be a mainstay, there are a few of us that will avoid this and will go for other options including a soak in the local spa.</p>
