                    <h2>Context of Trip</h2>
                    <p>A group of 7 friends are going to New Zealand, heading from the north to the south.</p>

                    <p>While each having their own intentions in the country, the activities will all be done together or in small groups.</p>

                    <p>With the 7 of us, we will be arranging two cars to be collected when we land in Auckland and from there, we will instantly be on our way to our first of three stops.</p>
                    
                    <!--Pagragraph includes a link to external page -->
                    <p>A large amount of the information we have obtained came from the New Zealand Tourism website. It proved to be a very useful tool to assist with the planning of a holiday to New Zealand.

                    <h2>Goals</h2>
                    <p>While all 7 friends will have different intentions, there are some goals that we all share.</p>

                    <p>These goals are linked to some of the places that we are visiting as well as the activities we are doing. </p>

                    <p>While we look to explore the country, we want to broaden our Lord of the Rings knowledge with a variety of different excursions and trips, perform various adrenaline activities without any injuries and experiencing different foods and drinks. </p>

                    <h2>Expectations</h2>
                    <p>Coming home from New Zealand, my hope is that the group becomes closer friends and takes lasting memories. </p>
                    
                    <p>I am expecting the country to have a beautiful landscape with a deep history that has been engrained in the culture. </p>
