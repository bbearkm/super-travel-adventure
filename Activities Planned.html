                    <p>Within the islands of New Zealand, there are a number of adrenaline activities that people are able to participate in. Within Rotorua there is a Skyline that includes Luge, Zipline, Sky swing and other activities. This will be something that the group will be attending while staying in Rotorua. You can see all of the things you can do here by clicking <a href="https://www.skyline.co.nz/en/rotorua/things-to-do/" Title="Skyline Rotorua" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                    
                    <p>Skiing and snowboarding is also an adrenaline activity that we will be doing when we get to Queenstown. With the time of year we will be in New Zealand, it will be a perfect time to head to the slopes and work on our balance. This is a n activity that many in the group are looking forward to and we have amended times around this to ensure we are spending as much time here as possible.</p>

                <section id="Exploration">
                    <h2>Exploration</h2>
                    <p>While in New Zealand, there are a number of things that we want to explore on both islands. Starting in the North where we will be landing, close to our first stop in Rotorua there is Hobbiton. This is a huge tourist attraction and a key reason for stopping in Rotorua. There are also the Waitomo Glow worm caves that are suppose t be breathtaking. After all of this, I am planning on taking the group to the mud pools for some rest and recovery before we head off to our next stop.</p>

                    <p>In Wellington, there will not be as much exploration. I want to visit the Royal Wellington Golf Club which appears to host two beautiful 18 hole courses.</p>
                    
                    <p>After this we start to move to Queenstown. On the way we stop off at Franz Josef Glacier. We spend a couple of nights here and while here we will be taking a helicopter tour around the Glacier. There are also motorised bikes that we can take up the glacier, however we will judge whether we do this closer to the date.</p>
                    
                    <p>With that stop off done, we move onto our final destination, Queenstown. Here will be mostly spent on adrenaline activities, however I will be looking into their local golf course options and spending more time in the local onsen relaxing after what was a jam packed holiday filled with adventure.</p>

                    <h2>Food</h2>
                    <p>There are a couple of food based activities that we have incorporated into the planning. This is mostly what we will be doing once we are in Wellington. With both a brewery tour and then a winery tour around the region, we will be looking at the best the area has to offer. </p>
